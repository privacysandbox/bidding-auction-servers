# Running servers locally

The scripts in this folder can be used to run B&A servers in a local system. This can be used for
sanity testing B&A locally or for debugging B&A code in test_mode. The scripts use docker to start
the servers. The logs will be output to stderr/stdout. Please review the environment variables and
usage commands in each script (including `tools/debug/common`) to understand all of the
customization options.

## Start Buyer stack with generateBid binary

### Using docker (recommended)

#### Prerequisites

Docker daemon should be up and running.

#### Build stack

```bash
./production/packaging/build_and_test_all_in_docker --service-path bidding_service --service-path buyer_frontend_service --instance local --platform gcp --build-flavor non_prod --gcp-skip-image-upload
```

#### Start stack

```bash
# Review the scripts to learn about which environment variables you can set
# to change behavior. Start with tools/debug/common.

# Open two new terminals at B&A project root.
# Start the Bidding server in terminal 1:
./tools/debug/start_bidding_byob
# You should see some logs in each server as it displays HTTP metrics for the first call to the generateBid executable endpoint and some errors for OTEL collectors not found.

# Start the BuyerFrontEnd server in terminal 2:
./tools/debug/start_bfe
# You should see some logs in each server as it displays HTTP metrics for the first call to the KV server and some errors for OTEL collectors not found.
```

### Using local bazel

Not supported.

```

## Test Buyer stack

### Plaintext request

Plaintext requests need to be created manually. For a Buyer stack, this should be a valid
GetBidsRawRequest object.

You can use the [secure_invoke] tool for sending a request to the buyer stack. The plaintext request
will be encrypted with a hardcoded key that the server can understand when running with the
test_mode flag set to true. Example -

```bash
# Setup arguments.
INPUT_PATH=/tmp/get_bids_request.txt  # Needs to be a valid GetBidsRawRequest
INPUT_FORMAT=PROTO
CLIENT_IP=<A valid client IPv4 address>

# Run the tool with desired arguments.
DOCKER_NETWORK=host ./builders/tools/bazel-debian run //tools/secure_invoke:invoke \
    -- \
    -target_service=bfe \
    -input_file="/src/workspace/${INPUT_PATH}" \
    -input_format=${INPUT_FORMAT} \
    -host_addr="localhost:50051" \
    -client_ip=${CLIENT_IP} \
    -insecure=true
```

### Encrypted request

Encrypted request must be a valid GetBidsRequest with an encrypted request_ciphertext. Currently,
there is no recommended way to get an encrypted ciphertext for testing.

## Test Seller stack

### Plaintext SelectAdRequest

Plaintext requests need to be created manually. For the expected format for this request, please
refer to the [secure_invoke] section.

You can use the [secure_invoke] tool for sending a request to the buyer stack. The plaintext request
will be encrypted with a hardcoded key that the server can understand when running with the
test_mode flag set to true. Example -

```bash
# Setup arguments.
INPUT_PATH=select_ad_request.json  # Needs to be a valid plaintext request in the root of the B&A project (i.e. the path is .../bidding-auction-server/select_ad_request.json)
CLIENT_IP=<A valid client IPv4 address>

# Run the tool with desired arguments.
DOCKER_NETWORK=host ./builders/tools/bazel-debian run //tools/secure_invoke:invoke \
    -- \
    -target_service=sfe \
    -input_file="/src/workspace/${INPUT_PATH}" \
    -host_addr="localhost:50053" \
    -client_ip=${CLIENT_IP} \
    -insecure=true
```

### Encrypted SelectAdRequest

Encrypted requests must be valid SelectAdRequests with an encrypted protectedAudienceCiphertext. The
ciphertext can be obtained from the client side (Chrome/Android), and the auction config has to be
populated manually. There are two ways to send encrypted requests to local servers -

1. gRPC - You can use [grpcurl] to send an encrypted payload to the seller stack.

    ```bash
    grpcurl --plaintext -H 'X-BnA-Client-IP:<A valid client IPv4 address>' -H 'X-User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.36' -H 'x-accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' -d '@' localhost:50053 privacy_sandbox.bidding_auction_servers.SellerFrontEnd/SelectAd < select_ad_request.json
    ```

2. HTTP - To send HTTP requests, you will have to route the requests through [envoy]. Envoy should
   be started in a separate terminal as follows -

    ```bash
    PROJECT_PATH=<Path to B&A project eg. ~/projects>
    docker run --rm -t --network="host" -v $PROJECT_PATH/bidding-auction-server/dist/bidding_auction_servers_descriptor_set.pb:/etc/envoy/bidding_auction_servers_descriptor_set.pb -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs -v $PROJECT_PATH/bidding-auction-server/tools/debug/envoy.yaml:/tmp/envoy.yaml envoyproxy/envoy:dev-3b18bc650237ce923176becc1e7ee0bd8de4b701 -c /tmp/envoy.yaml
    ```

    You can then send the request to envoy using CURL -

    ```bash
    curl --url localhost:51052/v1/selectAd -H 'X-BnA-Client-IP:<Valid IP address>' -H 'X-User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.36' -H 'x-accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' -d "@select_ads_request.json"
    ```

### GetComponentAuctionCiphertexts

Requests must be valid GetComponentAuctionCiphertextsRequest with an encrypted
protectedAuctionCiphertext. The encrypted ciphertext can be obtained using the [secure_invoke] tool
with -op='encrypt'.

```bash
grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"protected_auction_ciphertext":"", "component_sellers":["component-seller1.com", "component-seller2.com", "component-seller3.com"]}' localhost:50053 privacy_sandbox.bidding_auction_servers.SellerFrontEnd/GetComponentAuctionCiphertexts
```

Notes:

-   Change log level with the PS_VERBOSITY environment variable before starting the servers. To
    display all logs, set the level to 10.
-   You can only connect single instances of each server locally without a load balancer.
-   If you need to change the default port numbers for any servers, make sure and update the scripts
    for the server connecting to this updated server as well. For example, if the port for BFE
    changes, the address must also be updated in tools/debug/start_sfe.
-   Start Bidding server before BuyerFrontEnd server, so that BuyerFrontEnd can connect to Bidding
    on startup. Otherwise, requests might fail.
-   Start Auction server before SellerFrontEnd server, so that SellerFrontEnd can connect to Auction
    on startup. Otherwise, requests might fail.
-   Start Buyer stack before seller stack, so that SellerFrontEnd server can connect to buyer stack
    on startup. Otherwise, requests might fail.
